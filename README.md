### 🔭 Interests
I'm passionate about everything STEM—from building electronics to stargazing. I'm always eager to dive deeper into new areas, whether it’s programming, robotics, or astronomy.

### 💻 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, Java, C, C++
- **Data Analytics:** Pandas, NumPy, Tableau, Excel
- **AI & ML:** TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- **Hardware:** Arduino, Raspberry Pi
